= To Do List

The following is a list of planned expansions for HighLine, in no particular
order.

* Support <tt>ask(..., Array)</tt>, better than the current
  <tt>ask(..., lambda { |arr| arr.split(",") })</tt> or similar.
* Support <tt>ask(..., Hash)</tt>.
* Support <tt>ask(..., File)</tt>.
* Add readline support for history and editing.
* Add an easy-access help system for menus.
* Add tab completion for menu selection.
* Consider the addition of a character limit for input option.
