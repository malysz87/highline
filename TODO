= To Do List

The following is a list of planned expansions for HighLine, in no particular
order.

* From Markus Koenig:

  I think HighLine's methods should either raise EOFError or return nil
  if EOF is reached, but I'm not sure which one would be nicer. Maybe a
  hybrid approach, like IO#gets and IO#readline?

  The trivial script, if the methods return nil:

      require 'highline/import'
      loop do
          name = ask("What's your name?")
          if response.nil? or response == 'exit'
              puts 'Goodbye, dear friend.'
              exit
          else
              puts "Hello, #{name}!"
          end
      end

  I expect this program to behave like most Unix shells - quietly quit
  when one presses Ctrl-D (EOF). But this would print a stack trace, as
  shown earlier.
