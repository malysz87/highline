= To Do List

The following is a list of planned expansions for HighLine, in no particular
order.

* Support character oriented input.
* Support <tt>ask(..., Array)</tt>, better than the current
  <tt>ask(..., lambda { |arr| arr.split(",") })</tt> or similar.
* Support <tt>ask(..., Hash)</tt>.
* Provide for <tt>ask(..., MyClass)</tt>.
* Add word wrap support to say().
* Implement choose() for simple menu handling.
