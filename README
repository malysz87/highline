== Description

Welcome to HighLine.

HighLine was designed to ease the tedious tasks of doing console input and
output with low-level methods like gets() and puts().  HighLine provides a
robust system for requesting data from a user, without needing to code all the
error checking and validation rules and without needing to convert the typed
Strings into what your program really needs.  Just tell HighLine what you're
after, and let it do all the work.
