# <tt>require "highline/import"</tt> adds shorcut methods to Kernel, making
# agree(), ask(), and say() globally available.  This is handy for quick and
# dirty input and output.  These methods use the HighLine object in the global
# variable <tt>$terminal</tt>, which is initialized to used <tt>$stdin</tt> and
# <tt>$stdout</tt> (you are free to change this).  Otherwise, these methods are
# identical to their HighLine counterparts, see that class for detailed
# explinations.
